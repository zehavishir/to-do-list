## accessibility implementation

the accessibility in this project is from a few aspects:
color contrast: usage of a contrast between background color and color of elements such as the page itself and buttons.
aria-labels for screen readers: each element has its own aria label to describe what the purpose of the element.
live messages: in case of a change such as adding an item, deleting an item or completeing it, there will be a message in the bottom of the screen.
clear element with space between them for blury vision.
